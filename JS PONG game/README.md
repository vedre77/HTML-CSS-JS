# JS PONG game

NOTE: this canvas game is recommended to run in CHROME.

Interview question example: how does use of callback functions in object methods disrupt THIS?

Sync VS Async code.

JS is single threaded (one thing at a time).
setTimeOut(Fn, 1000) -> ASYNC function.

JS Runtime environment - Memory Heap / Call Stack
Web APIs (like a diff. universe from the Stack) / Callback queue => event loop => Stack.

Use canvas element in HTML!
const canvas = document.querySelector('canvas')
canvas.getContext('2d'); fillStyle, fillRect.
