Basic reminders:

OOP and FP are two different paradigms. Javascript and Python are multi-paradigm.
Types define how operators behave!
Const, let have BLOCK scope. Var has FUNCTIONAL scope!
SCOPE:
global/ local scope (onion) / shadowing.
TypeError and Syntax Error are very frequent!
Hoisting - function declaration is hoisted.
Function declaration - HOISTED vs. function expression - NOT HOISTED.
Arrow functions -> not hoisted, anonymous, no context binding, no args object (spread operator!); 
implicit return.
